# Book_store_web_app

I made this project for learning basics in the mvc .net projects.
By database first method as a first step four tables has been made.
Main focus is list tables  pages and doing CRUD operations on cshtml pages.


Database -> MSSQL
Controllers -> C#
ORM -> Dapper
Front-end -> bootstrap 5 / javascript (jquery,chart.js,selectize.js) / datatables
